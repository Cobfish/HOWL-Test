Rest assured that the parties responsible have been identified, arrested, tried, and executed. (09:26am UTC 21st Mar 2024\)  
Dispatch: INTELLIGENCE BRIEF. A new strain of flying Terminids has suddenly appeared across all Terminid planets, with no prior warning or indication of any kind. While the Ministry of Intelligence has always known this was a possibility, the abruptness of the evolution indicates a high possibility of dissident concealment. The deployment of Termicide was fortuitously timed—doubtlessly, it averted an even worse evolution. Helldivers are advised to exterminate these mutations whenever encountered.

Dispatch: OP SWIFT DISASSEMBLY, PHASE II—FAILED. The Automatons have retained **Tibit**, and its manufacturing facilities. Reports indicate they have already begun increasing production elsewhere. Intercepted bot chatter includes expressions of great sorrow for the "murder" of in-development bots—a transparent attempt at disinformation, as bots can neither feel nor be considered alive.

Dispatch: NEW MAJOR ORDER. OP SWIFT DISASSEMBLY, PHASE IV (FINAL): ANNIHILATION. All Helldivers are ordered to make an all-out push to completely destroy the Automaton Legion. Despite the enemy's losses, Automaton messages still include references to "The Reclamation." They must be annihilated before this plan can be carried out.

Dispatch: MOTIVATIONAL REINFORCEMENT. The Automatons are lifeless, emotionless, hateful socialists. They murdered innocent families. They ravaged **Malevelon Creek**. Worst of all, they threatened our way of life. All without any provocation or cause save a hard-coded hatred of Freedom. Save our citizens. Save Managed Democracy.

A massive Automaton Invasion Fleet, comprising tens of thousands of warships, arrived from FTL jump to the ***Valdis*** Sector and overran nearly every planet in just hours. Attacks on communications networks delayed warning until now. SEAF reserves are scrambling. All Helldivers are called to deploy immediately to the defense. This Fleet dwarfs the Automaton armies destroyed in Operation Swift Disassembly. As we predicted from the start, they were merely a vanguard. This is the Automatons' true force. Where the Automatons hid this fleet, and what their true intentions are—those questions must be answered later. The Reclamation has begun. (11:47pm UTC 9th Apr 2024\)

Dispatch: MAJOR ORDER WON. Valiant work, Helldivers. Thanks to your noble efforts, millions of tons of Terminid biomass has been rendered safe for collection, and is being processed into Element 710 as we speak. This surplus of fuel will enable the transport of weapons, equipment, and personnel to the frontlines of the Automaton fight. We now have the logistical means to enable and sustain an effective counter-offensive against the Automatons. Soon, we will take back lands they stole. (10:54am UTC 19th Apr 2024\)  
Dispatch: In further proof of their elite training and irreplaceable value, the Helldivers reached the target set for Terminid biomass production far faster than anticipated. While additional destruction of Liberty's enemies is always beneficial, E-710 refinement pipelines are full at the present time. However, there will be ample opportunities for additional biomass production in the future. **Super Earth** High Command commends the Helldivers for their boundless enthusiasm to destroy the enemies of Freedom.

Scientists on **Moradesh** are making progress on a way to combat the Supercolony. That will be Liberty's salvation. Until then, the Helldivers must hold the line at all costs.

**Acamar IV** of the ***Jin Xi*** sector is attacked by Terminids (03:19pm UTC 1st June 2024\)  
Dispatch: STRATEGIC UPDATE. The assault on the Supercolony appears to have spurred an increase in Terminid outbreaks on other planets. Scientists have likened this response to a kicked hornet's nest, from the beloved childhood pastime.

Day \#116 9:00am 2nd June 2024

Dispatch: NEW MAJOR ORDER. The time has come. The Democracy Space Station is fully constructed and ready for activation. The sole remaining step to bring the station online is the procurement of enough E-710 to power its High-Efficiency Alcubierre Drives. Haste is critical. The rebuilt Automaton ***Jet Brigade*** has been spotted amassing on **Vernen Wells**. An attack on the DSS Logistics Hub on **Tarsh** is likely imminent. If the Hub is seized, the DSS itself will be next. (02:04pm UTC 11th Nov 2024\)

DSS effect Planetary Bombardment is activated (02:34am UTC 15th Nov 2024\)  
Dispatch: STRATEGIC ADVISORY. All Helldivers should factor the following advisory into their strategic decision-making: Enemy forces stage their attacks on our planets from an originating planet. Liberating the originating planet ends the enemy attack immediately. In the current operational context, liberating **Mastia** would end the current Automaton attack on **Gaellivare**. (02:47am UTC 15th Nov 2024\)

Day \#282 9:00am 15th Nov 2024  
Dispatch: TEMPORARY DSS AUGMENTATION.

DSS effect Eagle Storm is activated (02:39am UTC 16th Nov 2024\)  
Dispatch: STRATEGIC UPDATE. In an unexpected but cunning move, the Helldivers have voted to send the DSS back to **Gaellivare** and activate its EAGLE STORM Tactical Action to hold the defense against the ***Jet Brigade***. This development has led to operations upon **Mastia** possibly gaining sufficient time to complete, and thereby end the attack upon **Gaellivare** by taking out its point of origin.

The Automaton unit's avaricious pursuit of the DSS led to their entrapment on **Imber**, where they were finally destroyed. But the totalitarianism is a resilient virus.

The Ministry of Expansion has identified several planets as rich in easily-accessible salt deposits, which can be mined rapidly for subsequent conversion to chlorine. The Helldivers are ordered to reclaim these planets from our enemies. If all planets can be secured within the specified timeframe, the MD-8 Gas Mines will be made available for immediate requisition in all Super Destroyers. (05:02pm UTC 5th Dec 2024\)

The **Center of Science** on this planet is of vital importance to stopping the ***Meridian*** Singularity. The Ministry of Science’s top astrophysicists are gathered there, researching both the Singularity itself and the Dark Energy that somehow powers its movement.

Dispatch: ALERT. A new Terminid strain, likely to have developed inside the Gloom, has been encountered near the **Center of Science** on **Fenrir III**. The Center’s Dark Energy research is now at critical risk. Scattered reports on the new Terminids indicate discoloration, increased intelligence, and drastic changes to hunting patterns. Information remains scarce, as no SEAF units have returned from close encounters. This variant group has been dubbed the ***Predator Strain***. (12:47pm UTC 15th Feb 2025\)

***Major Order*** | A2-3-2 Blockade the Singularity is issued | Objective: Eradicate (03:34pm UTC 7th Mar 2025\)  
Dispatch: NEW MAJOR ORDER. Analysis of gravitational waves has revealed that the Illuminate are sending accumulated Dark Energy directly into the Singularity itself. If that flow can be restricted, the Singularity can be slowed significantly. High Command has therefore ordered the establishment of a blockade surrounding the ***Meridian*** Singularity.  The Helldivers are ordered to aid in resource gathering for the fielding of this massive blockade fleet. Consult your Galactic Map for more details. (03:34pm UTC 7th Mar 2025\)  
Dispatch: STRATEGIC ALERT. Supply chain difficulties of an obtuse and tedious nature have caused significant fixed-wing armament shortages, increasing Eagle Re-Arm times by 30% fleetwide. The issue will shortly resolve itself and return to normal. However, rapid liberation of the Terminid-infested planet **BORE ROCK** would provide us a supply node that would reverse the effect, causing Eagle Re-Arm times to be 50% faster for the remainder of the order.
